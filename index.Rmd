The goal of this project is to predict if Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl is performed correctly using data form accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants to the experiment. participants were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways:

* exactly according to the specification (Class A),
* throwing the elbows to the front (Class B),
* lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C),
* lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D)
* throwing the hips to the front (Class E).

Class A corresponds to the specified execution of the exercise, while the other 4 classes correspond to common mistakes.

The training data for this project are available here:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv

The test data are available here:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv

The **classe** variable in training set is the outcome and is possible to use any of the other variables for prediction.
In this report I'll briefly explain:

* how I built predictive model,
* how I used cross validation,
* expectation regarding out of sample error.

Finally I'll show results of my prection on 20 cases in testing set.

## Loading and preprocessing the data

Raw data were loaded into **pml_training_raw** and **pml_testing_raw** data frames 

```{r load, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)

pml_training_raw <- read.csv("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv")
pml_testing_raw <- read.csv("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv")

pml_training <- pml_training_raw %>% 
      select(classe, ends_with("_X"), ends_with("_y"), ends_with("_z"))

pml_testing <- pml_testing_raw %>% 
      select(ends_with("_X"), ends_with("_y"), ends_with("_z"))
```
